# Risk-Assessment-Service
Creating an imaginary product

## Company principles

> We’re at the cutting edge of our field. So you’re working in uncharted waters and we like to test new ideas wherever we can.

- Customer obsession: serving the customer comes first.
- Deliver quality results: delivery value to their customers.
- Let the team shine: leveraging differences and building on the strengths of others.
- Challenge the status quo: confront their customer's problems and find simple solutions fast (change, iterate and innovate).
- Start small and learn fast: Do more with less and understand that funding doesn't start ideas - ideas start their funding.
- Hire and develop exceptional talent: see differences as an asset, and empower others to succeed on their own unique, irregular path.
- Courage: choose courage over comfort, and dare to engage in difficult conversations and decisions (opinions will not always be supported, but not speaking up is not an option).
- Detailed thinkers: ambitious, free-thinking with a meticulous eye for detail.

> Be yourself. Be curious.

### Behavioral questions

- Other situations alidned with the previous values.
